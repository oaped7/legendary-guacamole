                        <p class="lead"><em>The Bendiyan is an Ibaloi dance that originated in Kabayan, Benguet. It forms an important part of the Chungas ritual, a ceremony historically performed after a
                             successful head-taking raid. The term bendiyan comes from the Ibaloi word bedey, meaning untiring or doing something to the point of exhaustion. It was believed that anyone who participated in the Bendiyan would never tire during the dance.</em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="mb-4">Over time, the Bendiyan evolved from a ceremonial practice to a staged performance. Originally a victory dance, it later became associated with healing rituals and prayers for agricultural prosperity, and today, it is also performed to promote cultural appreciation and tourism in Kabayan.</p>

                        <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Historical Background</h3>
                        <p>The last recorded celebration of the original Bendiyan with an actual human head took place around 1851 to 1871. According to oral tradition, a warrior named Peang beheaded an important man from Sablan as part of a challenge.</p>
                        <p>By 1910, Bendiyan was performed without warriors or human heads, marking the beginning of its transformation. The final Bendiyan rites performed as community rituals occurred in Itogon in 1982 and Bocod in 1983, with only a single stanza of the angbawas chant remaining.</p>

                    <div class="mb-4">
                        <p class="lead"><em>The Tayaw, also known as the bird dance, is a general term for festival dances performed during various significant events such as weddings, thanksgiving ceremonies, sharing of blessings, death anniversaries, births, curing rituals, and other communal celebrations. Although many associate it mainly with the Cañao (community feast) as a form of joyous merrymaking, the Tayaw is actually an essential and meaningful part of nearly every ceremony among the Ibaloi, Kankanaey, and Kalanguya peoples of Benguet.</em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="mb-4">The musical accompaniment begins before the first dancer enters the space. A man draped with blankets over both shoulders steps to the center, arms outstretched in imitation of a bird in flight. He moves by hopping, skipping, and walking in rhythmic patterns, occasionally lowering his arms. He is then joined by a woman, who wears her blanket wrapped around her torso. They circle the dance area together until the mambunong (ritual priest) offers the basabas (ritual prayer), during which the dancers pause. After the first prayer, the dance continues until the final basabas, marking the end of the Tayaw. The mangangsa (main gong player) then passes the blankets to the next pair of dancers.</p>

                        <div class="mb-4">
                            <h5>1. Sagausau and Ritual Tayaw</h5>
                            <p>A form of Tayaw performed by a male dancer to a faster beat. The movements involve higher leaps and livelier steps.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mb-4">
                            <h5>2. Binukaw</h5>
                            <p>Meaning "like the movement of a hawk searching for prey," this dance is performed particularly when the menedjaw (a respected male leader or elder) is honored. Two menesung (female dancers) and one male dancer participate. The women enter from opposite sides, meet at the center, then follow the male dancer in a counterclockwise direction. Ordinary blankets are used in this dance.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mb-4">
                            <h5>3. Kedaring</h5>
                            <p>An earlier variation of the Tayaw performed during the Aremag ritual to honor deceased ancestors. The name is associated with the karing (brass bracelets) worn by women dancers. It uses the same melody and general steps as the regular Tayaw but requires at least five pairs of dancers. Blankets are placed in a kiyad or labba (winnower basket) for the dancers to use.</p>
                            <p>The dancers move in circles: men forming the outer clockwise circle and women the inner counterclockwise circle, symbolizing good ancestral spirits. A smaller circle represents spirits of individuals who died by suicide, reflecting the community's traditional view on such deaths.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mb-4">
                            <h5>4. Ginalding</h5>
                            <p>A Tayaw dance performed around the sacrificial pig. It follows the same steps as the regular Tayaw, but the prayers said before and after differ based on the ritual's purpose.</p>

                        <div class="mb-4">
                            <h5>5. Batbat Tayaw (Curing Ritual Tayaw)</h5>
                            <p>This Tayaw is divided into two parts: the first part is danced only by the host family, and the second part is open to the whole community. The transition is marked when the mambunong drapes a cloth over his body.</p>

                        <p>The gong and tik-tik players usually dance behind the main dancers, while the drum players remain at the outer edge of the circle. Elders are given priority in handling the gongs as a sign of respect, and blankets used in the dance are likewise first offered to them.</p>

                            <p>The dancing priest wears a balongosong, a crown-like headpiece decorated with chicken feathers. He picks up sharp ritual objects—usually a bolo and a spear—from a kiyag or labba (winnower basket).</p>
                            <p>He dances by hopping and forcefully stomping on the ground, circling the patient while shouting loudly to repel the malevolent spirit believed to cause the affliction.</p>

                            <p>The patient is brought outside to sit facing the doorway of the house. The dancer continues his movements, accompanied by the shouting of onlookers.</p>
                            <p>Traditionally, the dancer eventually replaces the bolo with the head of the sacrificial dog, holding it in one hand while still wielding the spear in the other. He points the spear into the air, circles wildly, and finally strikes the house door with the spear before scattering wood ashes onto the spot. This act signifies the expulsion of the harmful spirit and the conclusion of the ritual.</p>

                        <p class="lead"><em>The Taychek is a traditional dance of the Karao people performed during celebrations of successful headhunting in ancient times, abundant rice harvests, and thanksgiving occasions. It is an important part of the Babeng ritual—similar to the Ibaloi Peshit, a communal thanksgiving feast. During Babeng, host families share their blessings not only with relatives but also with neighbors and guests from other communities.</em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="mb-4">The dance and its rituals reflect the Karao's cultural history, particularly their past traditions of warfare and unity. Today, the Taychek is regarded as both a victory dance and a ritual offering for harvest and prosperity.</p>

                            <li>Female dancers are paired with male gong players.</li>
                            <li>Another pair acts as <strong>Chaligchig</strong> (escort dancers), who direct and signal the progression of the dance.</li>
                            <li>Performers hold a tobacco pouch while dancing; smoking is traditionally done after the dance while others continue the performance.</li>

                        <p class="mb-3">The dance begins with the men and women forming two facing lines. The men beat the gongs while the women match their marching steps to the rhythm. The Chaligchig dancers move forward, turn to face the women, lift their gongs, and hop toward them. At the command "Hoooo-ho!", they lower the gongs and bow.</p>
                        <p>This sequence is repeated until the dancers tire, and replacements may join at any time.</p>

                        <p>The Taychek is unique to the Karao and is not widely performed outside the community. This is unlike the Bendiyan, which has become more commonly performed in festivals. The Taychek holds deep ritual importance and must only be danced after the required ceremonies are completed. Violating these ritual steps is traditionally believed to bring misfortune.</p>
                        <p>This sacred nature explains why the Taychek is not widely known to many.</p>
                        <p>The Taychek and the related Kolimbet dance were once discontinued but were later revived for cultural preservation and community pride.</p>

                        <p class="lead"><em>The Binegbegan is a Kankanaey dance performed during the Pedit, a grand feast traditionally hosted by a wealthy family. This dance is derived from the Tallak dance but is slower, more refined, and has more graceful footwork.</em></p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="mb-4">The dance is led by a male and female main dancer who move in skipping steps around the dancing area, forming circles, semi-circles, or moving freely in any direction. At times, the main dancers weave among the gong players to showcase their steps. The bouncing or jumping motion distinguishes the Binegbegan from the Tallak dance.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">During evening celebrations, multiple pairs—often two or three—may dance at the same time, each pair trying to surpass the others in skill and elegance. When performed for formal ritual occasions or cultural presentations, the single-pair version is usually showcased.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The male dancer wears two native blankets draped loosely over his shoulders, while the female dancer has one native blanket wrapped securely around her torso.</p>

                        <p>Over the years, there has been a noticeable shift in dance preference from traditional cultural dances to the Grand March. This change is attributed to several factors, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Influences of colonization</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Acculturation and cultural exchange</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Growing interest in popular culture</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of available traditional musical instruments</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Limited transmission of sacred cultural dances</strong>, which are often performed only by elders</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p class="mb-3">Because many traditional dances are sacred and require proper ritual knowledge, younger generations have fewer opportunities to learn and perform them. As a result, the Grand March became more accessible and commonly practiced in social gatherings.</p>
